  <p>Our Company name is Chateau Wellington. Our accommodation development is situated in historic Wellington, situated on the southern coast of the North Island of beautiful Aotearoa (New Zealand).
    The Duke of Wellington was involved in the defeat of Napoleon, making a French connection, so in line with this connection and the fact that our accommodation is fit for a Duke, we have chosen the word ‘Chateau’ which in French means Castle.</p></div><!--provides a description for History-->
